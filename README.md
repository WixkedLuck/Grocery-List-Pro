# Grocery-List-Pro
Need to make a list?  Try our pro version 

The motivation behind this project was to create a more friendly todo list, specific for grocery shopping. The idea of a "pro" version came to mind seeing how there is always more features in a paid for application. 

- I built this project to further practice implementing different javascript ideas/elements. 

- This project resolves having a grocery todo list. A user starts by filling in the form and once completed the item is saved to local storage and displayed on screen. A few extra features are included in the settings menu such as a toggle for light/ dark mode, Local storage clearing, change pointer and a display time feature. 

- Completion of this project allowed for me to become more knowledgeable on advanced Javascript, Materialize CSS and creation of a "Pro" Grocery list application.
